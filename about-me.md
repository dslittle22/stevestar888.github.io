Hello! I am Steven Xu and I am currently a student at Bowdoin College studying Computer Science, while staying engaged in the breadth of the Liberal Arts curriculum. My coding projects are all available on [github](https://github.com/stevestar888).

This summer, I plan to start a job at Morningstar as a Software Engineer. At the moment, I am a growth (mostly SaaS and tech) dividend growth investor.

**And let's just be happy!**
