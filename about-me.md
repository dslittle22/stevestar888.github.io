Hello! I am Steven Xu and I am currently a student at Bowdoin College studying Computer Science, while staying engaged in the breadth of the Liberal Arts curriculum. Prior 


My coding projects are all available on [github](https://github.com/stevestar888).

This summer, I plan to start a job at Morningstar as a Software Engineer. At the moment, I am a growth (mostly SaaS and tech) dividend growth investor.


Computer Science has always attracted me for its fast-moving nature and its conduciveness for collaboration. I am a full-stack developer (in training) with an intimate understanding of algorithms and data structures. And, after my second summer internship with Unum, I am especially passionate about web accessibility (page layout/navigation, color contrast, screen reader usage, etc.). My public projects are available on github: https://github.com/stevestar888.

This summer, I plan to start a job at Morningstar as a Software Engineer. 


my curiosity: those that are impactful, innovative, and put the consumer-experience first. Iâ€™m grateful to bring experience (both in industry from two summers of interning and in academics from college classes) to the table.

On a personal level, I am an adaptable and open-minded individual with interests in tech, start-ups, history, investing, and personal finance. As a curious individual and constant learner, I strive to *understand* the subject matter and *relate* to experiences, and I am not afraid to ask for guidance or clarification. I focus on being a strong, clear communicator and know how to convey subject-matter at the appropriate technical level. I am also a fast and accurate typer, with fluency in Chinese (Mandarin). 

I'd be glad to connect, no matter who or where you are! Please feel free to message me here or send an email.


**And let's just be happy!**
