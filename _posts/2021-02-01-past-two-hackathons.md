Here is what some friends and I made during the last two hackathons. “It’s not much, but it’s honest work.” 

## Google Power Search (June 2020 during Hack the Northeast)
Nearly everyone uses Google to search the web, but there are actually some modifiers you can use to further refine your search. For example, putting `filetype:pdf` after your query will yield you results that are only PDFs. Similarly, putting `“minecraft update 1.18”` after your query will show results that explicitly have “minecraft update 1.18”. So, in essence, we built a GUI that lets you use the advanced operators without having to remember them. 

As you type in the text boxes / select for filetype, your Google search string is automatically generated. So, then, click the colorful search icon or press enter. While we didn’t include all operators, I think we covered most of the frequently used ones. Now, because I’m more familiar with the search operators, I’ll just manually type `filetype:pdf` or `site:reddit.com` because it rolls off the hand, but I find myself circling back to this for more involved searches.

See the ![site](http://google-power-search.rf.gd) for yourself or view the ![code](https://github.com/stevestar888/google-power-search) behind it.
